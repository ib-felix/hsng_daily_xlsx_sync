# HSNG Temporary .xlsx converter
This code simplifies data upload for the HSNG project. It's not intended to be a long term solution, but due to them having longer internal lead times we created this to ease the process. This should hopefully be taken down by the summer of 2024, let's see if it's still active when you read this at a hilariously later date.

It checks the import files for new or updated .xlsx files, and if there are any, it downloads them, converts to .csv and uploads the resulting file.
